Hi! My name is shah hayat ali and I'm studying data science. My previous experience in data science was a project with HR-data in our medium-business IT company. We've done anonymous research of our employee and their relations with managers, analysis of recruitment process and several other staff. I've never get in touch with big data, but our samples was pretty difficult and interesting to work for. My dream and my project for 2019 is transparent recruitment process analysis. From the very first marketing-touch with company (in social networks, media or special project) to the day of hiring. All the data like UTM or private feedback about recruiter should be carefully stored and analyzed.
